As an aerospace engineering student, landing a position at a rocket startup was a milestone I had been striving for. But the journey to secure that internship was anything but straightforward, filled with unexpected twists and hurdles.</p>
<p>I began my internship search in November 2022, focusing on European space startups that didn’t require citizenship for their job applications. This is often a significant barrier in the aerospace industry, where work closely tied to defense can restrict hiring to citizens only. However, the landscape is changing, with European space startups emerging that are more flexible with employee nationality. Rocket Factory Augsburg is one such startup, boasting a diverse, international team—a perfect fit for someone like me.</p>
<p>I applied through RFA’s job portal and was thrilled to be offered a position as a telemetry software project manager. My primary task was developing in-house software for project management. However, due to RFA’s dynamic nature, I soon found myself contributing to multiple teams within the avionics department, working on software for data visualization and analytics.
At one point, I was juggling projects for three different teams, even assisting in the development of the launch plan for RFA’s first rocket. This experience opened my eyes to the complexity of the rocket launching process, from multiple rounds of testing to the logistics of shipping massive rocket parts to the test site. For many, the constant shift in tasks might be overwhelming, but for me, it was perfect. It allowed me to interact with a wide range of people and learn a lot in a short period. Despite the challenges, RFA’s supportive work culture made the whole experience enjoyable.</p>
<p>##<strong>What I Loved About RFA</strong></p>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>1. **Extensive Onboarding**: RFA conducted in-depth onboarding sessions to familiarize new team members with their mission and current progress. These sessions covered everything from propulsion systems to various rocket components, providing a comprehensive understanding of the environment.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>2. **Supportive Colleagues**: The team at RFA was incredibly welcoming and helpful. Many colleagues assisted me in navigating German culture, and my supervisor was particularly supportive. Everyone I approached was willing to share insights about their work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>3. **Professional Communication in English**: Although German is the primary language in Germany, RFA operated mainly in English, which was a huge relief given my limited German proficiency.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>4. **Team Activities**: RFA’s HR department organized fun team-building activities that helped strengthen connections with colleagues.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>##<strong>Overcoming Challenges</strong></p>
<p>My adventure began in January, right in the middle of the freezing German winter. I often joked about pathetic fallacy—the dark and dreary weather mirrored my initial feelings of loneliness and overwhelm. Knowing no one in Germany and struggling with the language barrier, the first month was tough. Even everyday tasks, like reading road signs and shopping at supermarkets, were challenging because everything was in German.
I emphasize the challenges because, unfortunately, social media often portrays moving abroad as an incredibly enjoyable experience where everything happens smoothly. But it’s often completely opposite to that: moving abroad can be an incredible experience, but it comes with its due challenges. Not all days are going to be the same, and you can feel extremely out of place and uncomfortable. Therefore, be prepared before moving.</p>
<p>##<strong>My Advice for Aspiring Interns</strong></p>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>1. **Start Early**: The unpredictable nature of startups can complicate the hiring process. Make a list of potential companies and start applying early. Use official job portals or reach out to HR for available positions. Remember to allow time for visa processing.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>2. **Manage Expectations**: An overseas internship can be lonely initially. Assimilating into a new culture takes time, so be patient with yourself. Gather the courage to talk to people. I’ve always dealt with social anxiety, but I made the decision to interact with people around me. Use Bumble BFF and Meetup.com to find people who share your interests. It’s also very important to keep an open mind and explore. I started in January, and by May, I finally felt comfortable enough to call Augsburg another home.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>3. **Get Out of Your Comfort Zone**: Don’t stay cooped up in your room. Explore the city, especially in Europe where cities are very walkable. I often ventured out alone with music and Google Maps, discovering different areas of Augsburg and becoming more familiar with my surroundings.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>4. **Focus on Growth**: The work will be challenging, and you might feel lost at first. Give yourself time to adjust and improve. Embrace the learning curve and prioritize your growth.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>##<strong>Resource Links</strong></p>
<p>Following are resources that helped secure an overseas internship
1. <strong>Job Board</strong>: LinkedIn is, of course, a go-to for job searches, but another helpful platform is SpaceCrew. Otherwise, emailing the HR departments of companies is also an effective strategy, but it may take longer than job boards. Check out OHB’s career page for more opportunities.
2. <strong>Resume Format</strong>: You can view my resume format in the CV section. To build your own resume in a similar format, check out this resource: Harvard Resume Template.
3. <strong>Interview Process</strong>: The interview consisted of two rounds: one technical and one HR. They mainly tested my problem-solving approach and asked questions about my work experience and my comfort level with Python, as it was the main language for the job. The second round was an HR interview where compensation and the next steps regarding visas and work permits were discussed. My advice for interview preparation is to have a thorough understanding of the technical concepts underlying the job and to know your resume well. I advise against lying or exaggerating on your resume, as it can backfire during the interview when you’re asked to explain in detail. Instead, emphasize your learning and adaptability, which will give them confidence that you are dependable.</p>
<p>All in all, my time at RFA taught me a lot, and I made friends for a lifetime. I am so grateful for this experience, which made me a more confident and self-assured person. Everything I learned cannot be encompassed in just a few words. But I do recall the sense of pride I felt navigating that crowded Munich train station—the same station that initially overwhelmed me so much I wanted to cry. This is not just about a train station; it’s a reminder that failure does not limit us but rather provides another opportunity to succeed.</p>  </article> </main>  </main> </div> <footer class="footer footer-center block mb-5 pt-10"> <div class="pb-2">
